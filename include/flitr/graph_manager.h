/**
 * The Graph Manager
 *
 * \section sec_graph_manager_intro Introduction
 * The Graph Manager is a class that manages image processing elements and the paths
 * between them in a running application.
 *
 * An graph element can either be a producer or consumer. Or it can be a image processing
 * pass. The way that the elements are connected are specified using paths between
 * the elements. Consumers can only consume images from producers or passes. Producers
 * can not consume images from producers unless the producer pass.
 *
 * The manager loads information from and flitr::XMLConfig object for elements.
 * From this, paths are specified between elements to create processing chains or a
 * processing graph. The manager can then based on the name of graphs create or destroy
 * graphs using the added information about elements and the paths that the graph consists
 * of.
 *
 * This manager uses registered callbacks to create different elements, depending on the
 * registered categories and the category of the element. This allows the manager to be
 * generic enough so that it can be reused in many applications. To register a callback for
 * a specific category, look at the registerGraphElementCategory() function.
 *
 * Elements are only created on demand of creation of a specific graph. Thus one can specify
 * more elements in the configuration file than the total amount that will be used in the
 * application.
 *
 * If the runtime destruction of graphs are needed, it is vital that only the manager keeps
 * strong references to the elements that gets created by the callback functions. The
 * functions or classes that creates and uses these elements must use weak pointers to track
 * the lifetime, and only promote them to strong pointers if and when needed, to check if
 * they are still available. This will also ensure that they stay valid until the user is
 * finished with the element object.
 *
 * Creation of graphs can also happen during run time, given the manager is aware of the
 * elements and the paths that form part of the required graph.
 *
 * The manager is a singleton object so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the
 * application.
 * This class is not thread safe.
 *
 * \section sec_graph_manager_notation XML File notation
 * The following nodes are needed along with their attributes to be able to work with the
 * manager.
 * \subsection subsec_graph_manager_notation_element Graph Element
 * Elements are specified as follow:
 *     - <b>%Element name:</b> graph_element
 *     - <b>Attributes:</b>
 *         - \e name - Name of the element. This name must be unique between all elements
 *                      that will be added to the manager.
 *         - \e category - Category that the element is in. This will cause the registered
 *                      function associated with the category to be called to create and set
 *                      up the element.
 *          - ... - Any other attributes needed to create the element, used by the registered
 *                      callback function and ignored by the manager.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_graph_manager_notation_path Graph Path
 * Graph paths are specified as follow:
 *     - <b>%Node name:</b> graph_path
 *     - <b>Attributes:</b>
 *         - \e graph_name - Name of the graph that this link belongs to. Multiple nodes with
 *                  the same graph name can be specified to define a graph with multiple paths.
 *                  The paths does not have to be connected to each other but they will be
 *                  created and destroyed together.
 *         - \e producer_name - Name of the producer that will produce images in the path.
 *                  This must be the name of a producer defined as a Element node, and it must
 *                  be a producer. If the producer does not exist already, it will be created
 *                  using the registered callback. If it does exist it will be reused.
 *         - \e consumer_name - Name of the consumer that will consume the images from the
 *                  producer specified. Creation will follow the same logic as discussed above
 *                  for the producer.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_graph_manager_notation_graph Graph Creation
 * Graphs are created as follow:
 *     - <b>%Node name:</b> graph
 *     - <b>Attributes:</b>
 *         - \e name - Name of the graph that must be created. If the graph consists of more
 *                  than one path, each path will be created in the order that the paths are
 *                  specified in the file.
 *
 * \subsection subsec_graph_manager_notation_example XML Example
 * The following example can be used:
 * \code
 * <!-- Elements -->
 * <graph_element name="Camera1"      category="camera_video" Type="FFmpeg" address="MyVid.mp4"/>
 * <graph_element name="DisplayLeft"  category="display" location="left"/>
 * <graph_element name="DisplayRight" category="display" location="right"/>
 * <graph_element name="Recorder"     category="Recorder" root="/path/to/Recordings/">
 *
 * <!-- graph 1 -->
 * <graph_path graph_name="Graph_1" producer_name="Camera1" consumer_name="DisplayLeft"/>
 * <graph_path graph_name="Graph_1" producer_name="Camera1" consumer_name="Recorder"/>
 * <!-- graph 2 -->
 * <graph_path graph_name="Graph_2" producer_name="Camera1" consumer_name="DisplayRight"/>
 *
 * <graph name="Graph_1"/>
 * \endcode
 * In the above example, given the correct creators are defined, a graph is created that
 * will display <tt>MyVid.mp4</tt> on the left side of the display and create a recorder
 * connected to the camera.
 *
 * If both graphs are specified to be created, the display should be duplicated on left and
 * right, based on the implementation of the creation callbacks.

     *
     * A strong pointer to the creation object must be passed to the manager. The manager does
     * not take ownership of this object, it uses it only to monitor the lifetime of the object.

     * must return with false. If the element was created successfully, the correct pointer
     * must be set based on the type of element. If the created object is a producer, the
     * \e producer pointer must be set to point to the newly created producer.
     *
     * If a consumer is created, the \e producer pointer will be a smart pointer to the
     * producer that must be consumed by the new consumer. After successful creation of the
     * consumer the \e consumer pointer must be set to the new consumer.
     *
     * If the consumer is an image processor or pass, it must also set the \e producer pointer
     * to point to itself to indicate to the manager that it is a pass.
     *
     * To register a callback the following must be done:
     * \code
     * // Define a class that will create the element
     * class CameraCreator
     * {
     * public:
     *     CameraCreator();
